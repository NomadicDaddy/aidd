# AIDD Shared File Synchronization
#
# This file lists individual files to copy to all projects at the start of each iteration.
# Rename this file to "copyfiles.txt" and add file paths (one per line).
#
# Use cases:
# - Sync specific config files (e.g., .prettierrc, .editorconfig)
# - Share individual templates or scripts
# - Distribute license files or common documentation
#
# Format: One entry per line, with optional target path
#   <source_path>                      - copies to project root with same filename
#   <source_path> -> <target_path>     - copies to specified relative path in project
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and are ignored
# Empty lines are ignored
#
# Examples (uncomment and modify for your environment):
#
# /d/applications/shared/.prettierrc
# /d/applications/shared/.editorconfig
# /d/applications/CLAUDE.md
