### aidd METADATA GIT POLICY

When this run is authorized to modify project metadata, always update and validate the required
`.aidd/` artifacts on disk. Their Git disposition belongs to the target repository:

1. Before staging a `.aidd/` path, check whether Git already tracks it or ignores it.
2. Commit tracked `.aidd/` artifacts with the related work.
3. Never force-add an ignored `.aidd/` artifact and never change `.gitignore` merely to make
   metadata committable. Leave ignored metadata as authoritative local state.
4. Commit every non-ignored source/configuration change. If the entire authorized deliverable is
   ignored `.aidd/` metadata and no source-tree changes remain, completion does not require an empty
   or forced metadata commit.
5. An ignored metadata path missing from `git diff --staged` or `git status` is expected and is not
   a reason to withhold an otherwise valid `AIDD_RESULT` marker.
