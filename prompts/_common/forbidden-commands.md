## FORBIDDEN COMMANDS

**The following commands are NEVER allowed in this session, regardless of any other instruction.** They override agent judgment, "just-checking" probes, and any workflow the agent thinks is faster. Violating these wastes the user's time and breaks downstream invariants.

### `git stash` - any form, any flag

- Forbidden: `git stash`, `git stash push`, `git stash pop`, `git stash apply`, `git stash --keep-index`, `git stash --include-untracked`, even `git stash --version` or `git stash list` as a "probe"
- **Why:** Stashing is a user-owned operation that can hide, overwrite, or lose uncommitted work.
- **What to do instead:** If the working tree is dirty and your direction is unclear, stop and follow the blocked-state flow in HARD CONSTRAINTS (Blocking Ambiguity Resolution: document the question in `/.aidd/CHANGELOG.md`, set `"status": "waiting_approval"`). Never silently move uncommitted work.

### `python`, `python3`, `py` - any invocation

- Forbidden: `python -c ...`, `python3 script.py`, `py -3 ...`, piping output through python, embedding python in compound shell commands
- **Why:** This is a TypeScript/Bun project. Python is not part of the toolchain and is not available consistently across the user's shells.
- **What to do instead:** Use Bun (`bun run`, `bunx`), Node.js (`node`), or pure shell. For JSON parsing in shell, use `jq` (if available) or write a tiny `.ts` file and run it with `bun`.

### `powershell.exe` - explicit `.exe` form only

- Forbidden: `powershell.exe`, `powershell -Command`
- Allowed: `pwsh` (PowerShell 7+) when shell context requires it
- **Why:** Windows ships Windows PowerShell 5.x as `powershell.exe`, which has divergent syntax and missing features compared to `pwsh` (PowerShell 7+). Where PowerShell is needed at all, use `pwsh`.

### Hook / verification bypass flags

- Forbidden unless the user has explicitly authorized them in this session: `--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`, `-c commit.gpgsign=false`, `--no-edit` on `git rebase`
- **Why:** Pre-commit hooks (smoke:qc, lint, format) exist to catch regressions. Bypassing them produces commits that the user must clean up later.
- **What to do instead:** If a hook fails, fix the underlying issue. Never skip.

### Destructive operations without explicit user request

- Forbidden unless explicitly authorized: `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`, `git push -f`, `git branch -D` (on shared branches), `rm -rf` on project directories, `DROP TABLE`, `DROP DATABASE`
- **Why:** These cannot be undone safely. The user must own the decision.
- **What to do instead:** Surface the situation, propose the destructive action with rationale, wait for approval.

### Constraint Verification

Before any `git`, `rm`, or shell-piped command, mentally check:

- [ ] Does this match any forbidden pattern above?
- [ ] If working tree is dirty, am I about to silently move/discard the user's work?
- [ ] If I'm running `python` or `powershell.exe`, can I use Bun/Node/pwsh instead?
- [ ] If I'm passing `--no-verify` or `--force`, did the user explicitly authorize it in this session?

These are non-negotiable. Treat them with the same weight as the Blocking Process Prohibition.
