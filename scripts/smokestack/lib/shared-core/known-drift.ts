/**
 * KNOWN DRIFT. A fatal row the owner has already looked at, has a reason for and has given an owner
 * and an end date, so that it stops turning every gate red while it waits on its fix (Phillip,
 * bottleneck item 6). The rows it can name are the drift a target holds and the owner cannot settle
 * from here, such as a repository with no lock that a delivery has not reached yet.
 *
 * Each entry names one row exactly: its repository, its group, its finding kind and its detail, the
 * text the check prints after the repository's name. It also gives the reason, the owner and the
 * date it expires. Until that date, inclusive, the fatal finding with that identity is reported as
 * KNOWN-DRIFT and does not fail the check. Any other row, in the same repository or not, still
 * fails: an entry accepts the row someone looked at, never a class of rows nobody has seen yet. From the next day the row fails again, and the run says
 * which entry ran out. An entry may not expire more than 14 days after the day it is read: a list
 * that could hold a row back indefinitely would be the standing red this exists to end, made quiet.
 *
 * The list names sibling repositories, so like the rosters and frozen-targets.json it is untracked,
 * only its `.example` is tracked, and a branch worktree reads the main checkout's. A missing list
 * means nothing is known, which is the safe reading: every row then fails as it would without it.
 * Only `--check` reads it. A write still replaces a drifted file, known or not.
