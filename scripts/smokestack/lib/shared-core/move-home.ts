/**
 * The part of a move that no manifest group describes: what smokestack keeps in a repository
 * without delivering it. move.ts moves the delivered files a lock records; these are not in any
 * group, so their old homes are named here.
 *
 *   - the lock, at the root before v0.6.0 (lock.ts PREVIOUS_LOCK_FILE). lock-write.ts writes the new
 *     one; this removes the old one once the new one is on disk;
 *   - the repository's `smokestack.json`, at the root before v0.6.0. It is the repository's own, so
 *     it is renamed into scripts/smokestack/, never rewritten;
 *   - core.hooksPath, which names the folder the delivered hooks were moved out of. It is a clone's
 *     setting, so it is set here for the fleet's checkout and by leak-guard-setup.sh in every other.
 *
 * Refused, as move.ts refuses, before anything is written: a lock or a config at both places (the
 * one at the new path is not one this write put there), and a hook that is the repository's own
 * (a foreign hook or a local chain the lock recorded at the old folder) still running a file this
 * write moves. Such a hook stays where it is, since the delivered hooks run it from there, and
 * would then fail every commit; the lead rewrites it first.
