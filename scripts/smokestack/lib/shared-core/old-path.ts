/**
 * `old-path`: a reference left pointing at where a group used to be installed.
 *
 * Once a target's lock records a group where the manifest installs it, the write has moved that
 * group's files and removed their old copies (move.ts). The write also rewrites a package.json
 * script naming an old path once; a script naming it twice is refused and left for the lead to
 * rewrite. A script still naming an old path then runs a file that is no longer there, and a hook
 * still naming one chains a guard that is no longer there. Either is fatal, like a lost delivery,
 * and so is an old copy still on disk, which nothing will remove once the lock stops naming it.
 * So is a clone still dispatching from the folder the hooks left: git runs no delivered hook there.
 *
 * An old path is one a tagged release of this repository installed the group at, which the
 * manifest no longer installs at, and which ends with a file's `source`, the same pairing the
 * write moves by. Read from history, because by the time this is asked the lock no longer records
 * it. package.json scripts, the owner's delivered hooks and the repository's own hooks they run are
 * read in full. A consumer's own imports, configs and documents are its lead's to change in the
 * delivery commit, and the write lists every one (references.ts); of those, only a relative import
 * that resolves to an old path no longer on disk is a finding here, because it cannot typecheck.
