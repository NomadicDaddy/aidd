 * tracked file is modified or staged. The bytes themselves are not read from this guarantee but from
 * the tag commit (taggedBatches), so a file that differs from its blob without git reporting it
 * modified still delivers the tagged bytes; the refusals here keep the working tree an honest
 * witness rather than the source of what ships.

 * is the known way — cannot leak disk bytes into a delivery. A write delivers many files, and a
 * git spawn per file costs more than the read itself on Windows; cat-file --batch answers the whole
 * report from one process. A path git cannot produce maps to null — the same refusal a single
 * missing read would raise — and a batch that fails outright yields an empty map, which blocks
 * every path it was asked for rather than letting any write fall back to disk.
